### Condition
1. User can select grid type randomly, one grid, two or three or four.
2. Grid type1 is selected, then html element id is element1, which can be a canvas area for drawing.
3. Grid type2 is selected, then html elements are element1 element2, each elements is passed to next process sequencially.
4. Grid type2 is selected, process of element2 have to wait until element1 is completing rendering process.
5. Each split window has multiple images, which is got from server by async communication.
6. Each split window display only one image and others are cached
7. When multi grid type is selected, while the previous split window start to cache after displaying the first image, next split window start to rendering process.

![image1](assets/images/split-window1.png)

For each split window has it's own element id like as ( element1, element2, element3, element4)

- case 1: One split window (Grid type 1),
	With defined grid size, template and element id, start to image rendering.
- case 2: Multi split window. (Grid type 2, Grid type 3, Grid type 4)
	1. With defined grid size, template and element id, start to rendering from the first split window.
	 2. The next split window wait until the previous split window completing rendering.

![image2](assets/images/split-window2.png)

Using zip operator (rxjs) to wait the next process complete.

- case1: One split window.  
1. Above diagram, step 3 is already made, step 4 is mader just the time when grid type1 is selected.

- case2: Multi split window.
1. isStartedRendering: status of starting rendering. Should check if element id of previous split window is the same with id of isFinishedRendering$ value. 
2. isFinishedRendering: status of complete rendering and related side job. 
3. above step 1. and step 2. job is completed.
4. When user select grid type, create this observable for wating above step 3. 
5. When step3 and step4 is completing, it means one of next split window processing is ready to start.

![image3](assets/images/split-window3.png)

1. Start with new html element id
2. currentCtViewerElementId$: Observale that get the signal of start or end rendering.
3. isStarted$
4. isFinished$
5. Check if this is the final process of grid no. if not, continue next split window process. 
6. End of rendering split window

```ts
    renderingSplitWindows() {
        const isFinished$ = this.currentCtViewerElementId$.pipe(     // 1
            switchMap(val => {
                this.selectedElementId = val.selectedElementId;     // 2
                return this.ctService.isFinishedRendering$[this.selectedElementId]
                    .pipe(take(1)); 				// 3
            }),
            takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$)
        );

        const isStarted$ = this.currentCtViewerElementId$.pipe(      // 4
            switchMap(val => {
                this.selectedElementId = val.selectedElementId;
                return this.ctService.isStartedRendering$[this.selectedElementId]
                    .pipe(take(1));
            }),
            takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$)
        );
        // 
        if ( gridNo > 1 ) {
            if (this.selectedElementId === 'element1') {         // 5
                this.tempObservable = defer(() => of(EMPTY).pipe());
            } else if (this.selectedElementId === 'element2') {
                this.tempObservable = zip(isStarted$, isFinished$).pipe(  //['element2','element1']
                    filter(val => val[1] === 'element1'),        // 6
                );
            } else if (this.selectedElementId === 'element3') {
                this.tempObservable = zip(isStarted$, isFinished$).pipe( //['element3','element2']
                    filter(val => val[1] === 'element2'),
                );
            } else if (this.selectedElementId === 'element4') {
                this.tempObservable = zip(isStarted$, isFinished$).pipe( //['element4','element3']
                    filter(val => val[1] === 'element3'),
                );
            }
        } else { // only one split window
            this.tempObservable = defer(() => of(EMPTY).pipe());    // 7
        }
    }

```

```ts
    private initialize() {
        const rendering$: Observable<any> = this.requestSplitWindow$[this.selectedElementId];
                                                                    // 8
        zip(this.tempObservable, rendering$).pipe(   // 9
            take(1),
            tap((val) => {
                const data = {selectedElementId: val[1]};
                /** Forward this to Webviewer-vertical.component.
                 * Where this value is used to call function "getNodules" */
                this.store.dispatch(new SetSelectedElementId(data));
            })
        ).subscribe((val) => {
            this.renderingCtViewerSplitWindow(val[1]);              // 10
        });
  }
```
showSelectedSeriesToViewer
	this.store.dispatch(new SetSelectedCtViewer(data)) --> currentCtViewerElementId$
	
1. currentCtViewerElementId$, when process arrive at the proper position of checking, 
2. then pass current element id, and make observable 
3. and wait previous process ending.
4. Same as above step 1,2,3 except waiting the process reach the start state.
5. If multiple grid type is selected, start to check from first grid.
6. Because this is the second split window, element of previouse split window must be element1. (isFinished$ === element1, isStarted$ === element2), 
7. When Grid type1 is selected (one split window), there is no need to step5 and step 6.
8. Make observable for each element for waiting rendering previous split window, which can be used parameter of zip operator (rxjs),  
9. rendering$ and tempObservable can be the signal of rendering split window by the zip operator. 
10. Start processing ct-viewer after finished processing for previous split window\
    val[1] may be 'element1' if Grid type1 is selected, 'element2' if Grid type2 is selected.
